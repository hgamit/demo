Issue #ADSO-4774 - DB Request for ADSO-4055

Project : Amphora Dev Symphony Oil


Description :
Please prepare a script as part of CS3.0 to update associated_cpty in existing inventory build draw records with related acct_num from trade. Logic is to set the acct_num from trade row related associated_trade column in inventory_build_draw column. There are three cases
when associated_trade column has one T/O/I - fill related acct_num from trade
when assocoated_trade has multiple TIs - fill  associated_cpty as 'Multiple'
when associated_trade is null - fill associated_cpty as null.

Below script can be used as reference, optimize it as necessary

select associated_trade,
CASE when charindex(',',associated_trade,0) > 1 or charindex('m',associated_trade,0) = 1 THEN -1  -- Cases where it has two or more TIs
 When charindex('/',associated_trade,0) > 1 THEN substring(associated_trade,0,charindex('/',associated_trade,0))  -- one TI
  ELSE -2 END as tradenum, 
inv_num,inv_b_d_num into #temptable from inventory_build_draw

--update invbd 

update invbd set invbd.associated_cpty =  CASE WHEN tradenum =-1 THEN 'Multiple' 
WHEN tradenum > 0 THEN convert(varchar(30),t.acct_num) 
ELSE null END 

from inventory_build_draw invbd
inner join #temptable temp on temp.inv_num = invbd.inv_num and temp.inv_b_d_num=invbd.inv_b_d_num
left outer join trade t on temp.tradenum=t.trade_num

drop table #temptable

DB CHANGES:

    Updated 'associated_cpty' column in 'inventory_build_draw' table based on the below conditions:
	
    
    Case 1: 
			when associated_trade column has one T/O/I - fill related acct_num from trade
	Case 2:
			when assocoated_trade has multiple TIs - fill associated_cpty as 'Multiple'
	Case 3:
			when associated_trade is null - fill associated_cpty as null.
